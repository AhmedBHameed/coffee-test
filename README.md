Simple game for demonstration.

![game demo](./src/assets/coffee_game.gif)

# Installation

- `git clone https://github.com/AhmedBHameed/coffee-test`
- `npm install` OR `yarn`
- `yarn start`

## What's included

- Bundling with parcel
- Dev server with hot module replacement
- React 16
- styled-components

## Usage

Drink as much coffee as you can without overflow it. Till you get drunk with good stuff of coffee ;)

## Some hurdles

- I guess the boiler plate is old and using `parcel` which causing an issue on `build` that i could not solve it due to some constrains of the demonstration owner. I would suggest to apply the game with the newest React boiler plate since they use either `babel` or `typescript` or other task bundler.

- I tried to do PWA but with no success! The process was giving an error that even with search i did not find useful info regarding. The error was `DOMExpection`
